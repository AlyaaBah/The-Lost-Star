##  About The Project 
**The Lost Signal** is an immersive browser-based game developed specially for the **Athar Exhibition 2026**. The project gamifies the concept of "finding meaning in noise," challenging players to locate hidden signals within a vast starfield.

The ultimate goal is to decode a hidden message related to **AI Ethics**, emphasizing that technology requires a moral compass.

###  Mission Objectives:
* **Locate Signals:** Use the signal strength meter to find hidden nodes in the galaxy.
* **Decode the Message:** Reveal the hidden phrase word by word.
* **Beat the Clock:** Complete the mission before the connection is lost.
* **Earn Certification:** Successful agents receive a personalized digital certificate.

##  Technical Highlights 
Even though the source code is private, here is an overview of the engineering behind the simulation:

* **Core Framework:** Built with **Python** using the **Streamlit** library for rapid web deployment.
* **Frontend Logic:** Custom **HTML5 & JavaScript** integration tailored for:
    * Particle systems (Starfield background).
    * Real-time collision detection (Mouse tracking vs. Hidden targets).
    * Dynamic DOM manipulation for the UI (Signal bars, Timers).
* **Canvas Rendering:** The certificate generation is done purely via client-side Canvas API, allowing instant downloads without server overhead.
